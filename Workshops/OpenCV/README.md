# OPENCV WORKSHOP

This is a brief introduction to Python and OpenCV, and how to use it for image processing.

## Python

Python is a code-readable language that is easy to learn and use. It is a great language for beginners and is used in many fields, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more.

### Installing Python

There are many ways to install Python, we would use `brew` to install Python. We installed `brew` in the previous workshop, so we can use it to install Python.

```bash
brew install python
```
After installing Python, you can check the version of Python installed by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python --version
```

### Writing our first Python code

To write our first Python code, we will create a file called `hello.py`. First, open your terminal and navigate to the desired directory. Then, use the following command to create the file:

```bash
touch hello.py
```

Open the file in your text editor and write the following code:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

Now, let's save the file and run it in the terminal:

```bash
python hello.py
```

You should see `Hello, World!` printed in the terminal.

## OpenCV

OpenCV is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library. It is used for image processing, object detection, and more. OpenCV has a Python library that we can use to perform various image processing tasks.

### Installing OpenCV

We can install OpenCV using `pip`, which is a package manager for Python. 
    
```bash
pip install opencv-python
```
