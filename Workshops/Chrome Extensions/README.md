# Bookmarklets and Chrome Extensions

This is a brief introduction to bookmarklets and chrome extensions, two methods of altering a person's experience of the web browser. We will be using vanilla Javascript. Taking the form of a bookmarked link, bookmarklets are small snippets of Javascript code that perform a specific function on the current page youâ€™re viewing. Unprofessionally, I would say that bookmarklets are like Chrome extensions lite. Chrome extensions can do everything that a bookmarklet does and more, but with a higher technical barrier of entry.
