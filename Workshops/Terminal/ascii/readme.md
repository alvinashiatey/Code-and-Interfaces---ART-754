# ASCII Art with the jp2a command line tool

To begin, we must install the jp2a command line tool. To do so, open the terminal and type `brew install jp2a` and press enter.

Once installed, we can utilize the jp2a command line tool to convert images into ASCII art. To do this, open the terminal and type `jp2a <image path>` and press enter. For example, to convert the image `./images/pencil-brick.png` into ASCII art, open the terminal and type `jp2a ./images/ascii.png` and press enter.

For more information about the jp2a command line tool, open the terminal and type `man jp2a` and press enter. Alternatively, you can visit the [jp2a GitHub repository](https://github.com/cslarsen/jp2a).
