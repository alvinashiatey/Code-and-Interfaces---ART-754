# Code and Interfaces Art 754

## Description

This project- and discussion-based course explores our relationship with digital tools within the discipline of graphic design. We mostly find ourselves using the same proprietary software, which can box us into a narrow range of possibilities. In this course, we look into the potential of expanding that box by retooling, recontextualizing existing technologies in new ways, creating pipelines between technologies, and developing new or specific technologies for our toolkit. The aim of the class is to rethink the technologies we use and uncover new or non-traditional models of knowledge-making. This is achieved through a combination of lectures, group discussions, workshops, and a culminating class project. No prior experience or software development skills are required for this class. All that is needed is an open mind and a willingness to be creative with different media.
